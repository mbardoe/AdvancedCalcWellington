## 1. Why Are We Talking About Limits?

A **limit** tells us what value a function is getting close to as $x$ approaches a certain number —  
**even if** the function isn’t defined at that point or jumps to a different value.

**Example from today’s activity:**  
At the jump in our mystery function, $x =$ ____________, the function’s value was ____________,  
but the value the graph was getting close to from the left was ____________, and from the right was ____________.

### Question:
Why can’t we just “plug in” $x$ at a jump discontinuity?

## 2. Informal Definition of a Limit

We say:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$

if $f(x)$ gets **arbitrarily close** to $L$ when $x$ is **close to** (but not necessarily equal to) $a$.

**Fill-in-the-blank:**
- The number $a$ is the **_________** we are approaching.
- The number $L$ is the **_________** the function approaches.
- We care about what happens **_________** $x = a$.

## 3. One-Sided Limits

Sometimes we need to look at a limit **just from one direction**:

- **Left-hand limit:**  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)
  $$  
  Approaching $a$ from the **_________**.

- **Right-hand limit:**  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)
  $$  
  Approaching $a$ from the **_________**.

---

**Key Fact:**  
For $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ to exist, the **left-hand limit** and **right-hand limit** must:
1. **Both exist**
2. **Be equal**

## 4. Why Limits Exist (or Don’t)

### Limits exist when:
- The graph approaches the **same height** from both sides.
- The function may or may not be **defined** at that point.

### Limits do not exist when:
- The left and right sides approach **different heights** (jump discontinuity).
- The function grows without bound in at least one direction (**vertical asymptote**).
- The function **oscillates** too wildly as $x$ approaches the point.

## 5. Your Turn

For the piecewise function from today’s activity:

1. At $x = \_\_\_\_$, find:
   - Left-hand limit: $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \_\_\_\_$
   - Right-hand limit: $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \_\_\_\_$
   - Function value: $f(a) = \_\_\_\_$

2. Does the limit exist? Circle one: **YES** / **NO**  
   Why?

## 6. Big Idea

> A limit is about **approach**, not arrival.  
> We care about what’s happening **near** the point, not necessarily **at** the point.
