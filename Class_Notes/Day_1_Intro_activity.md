# Part 1: Guess the Graph

Your teacher has a **mystery function**.  
You can give any $x$ value you like, and your teacher will tell you $f(x)$.  
Your goal: figure out what the graph looks like and what rules define it.

## Table of Test Points

| $x$ | $f(x)$ | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
|     |        |       |
|     |        |       |
|     |        |       |

## Coordinate Grid

\vspace{0.5cm}

Draw your points on the grid below as you collect them.  
Look for patterns: Are there straight-line segments? Does the graph “jump” anywhere?

*(If using printed handouts, attach or draw a blank grid here.)*

# Part 2: What’s Happening at the Jump?

When you think you know the graph:

1. Mark where you think the jump happens.
2. On the left side of the jump, find the slope and $y$-intercept of the line.
3. On the right side of the jump, do the same.

---

**Left side:**

Slope: ___________________  
Intercept: _______________

**Right side:**

Slope: ___________________  
Intercept: _______________

# Part 3: Write the Piecewise Function

Write your function using piecewise notation.  
Make sure to include the rule for each part of the graph, and specify which $x$ values go with which rule.

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ & x < \_\_\_ \\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ & x \ge \_\_\_
\end{cases}
$$

# Part 4: Check Your Function

Test your function with points you didn’t use in Part 1.  
Does your formula match the original outputs from the teacher?

---

# Reflection

1. How can you tell from a graph that a function has a **jump discontinuity**?  
   \vspace{2cm}

2. At the jump, is the function defined? How is that different from the limit from the left or right?
