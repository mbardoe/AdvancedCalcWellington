# Trimester 1 Project Ideas

* Image processing
* Econ (elasticity)
* There are a variety of simplifications based on derivatives that are common in science and other settings: $sin(x)$, $ln(1+x)$, $e^x$



# Calculus Project: The Derivative in Action

## Overview
The derivative is more than a slope — it’s a tool used across science, engineering, economics, and art.  
In this project, you will **research a real-world use of the derivative**, create a **visual or hands-on demonstration**, and present your findings to the class.

---

## Project Goals
By the end of this project, you will:
1. Understand how the derivative is applied in a specific field or problem.
2. Explain the concept clearly to your peers.
3. Show the derivative **in action** using data, visuals, or a live demo.
4. Connect mathematical ideas to real-world contexts.

## Topics
Choose one of the topics below (no repeats in the class). We will select topics using a **Topic Draft** during class.

### 1. Economics: Elasticity
- Explain **price elasticity of demand** and how it uses derivatives.
- Show how elasticity changes at different points on a demand curve.
- Include a real or simulated dataset (e.g., historical price and demand data).
- Demo idea: interactive graph where you can “raise” or “lower” prices and watch elasticity change.

### 2. Common Derivative Approximations
- Explore how derivatives are used for **linearization and small-quantity approximations**.
- Classic examples:
  - $\sin(x) \approx x$
  - $e^x \approx 1 + x$
  - $\ln(1+x) \approx x$
  - $(1+x)^n \approx 1 + nx$
- Choose at least one real-world context (e.g., physics small-angle approximation, finance growth rate estimate).
- Demo idea: compare exact and approximate values in a graph or table, highlight where the approximation fails.

### 3. Image Processing: Edge Detection
- Explain how numerical derivatives highlight rapid changes in pixel brightness.
- Show how convolution with derivative filters (Sobel, Prewitt) reveals edges in an image.
- Include a real image (photo you take or one from the internet).
- Demo idea: apply a derivative-based filter and show before/after images with explanations.

### 4. Newton’s Method in Action
- Explain how Newton’s Method uses derivatives to find roots of equations.
- Demonstrate cases of fast convergence and cases where the method fails or converges slowly.
- Include visualizations showing tangent-line steps approaching (or missing) the root.
- Demo idea: Animate Newton’s Method in Desmos, GeoGebra, or Python so the iterations appear step-by-step.

## Requirements

### 1. Deliverables
- **5–7 minute presentation** to the class.
- At least one **visual or hands-on demo** (graph, animation, code, physical model, or experiment).
- A **1-page summary** with:
  - Key definitions
  - The main formula(s) you used
  - One worked example

### 2. Timeline
- **Topic Draft:** [Date]
- **Check-In Day:** Share your main example/demo idea with the class. [Date]
- **Presentation Day:** [Date]

### 3. Audience Involvement
- Include at least one moment where you **ask the audience a question** or invite participation.

## Grading Rubric

| Criterion | Excellent (A) | Proficient (B) | Needs Work (C) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Understanding** | Explains the concept in depth, connects to broader ideas | Explains core concept correctly | Some inaccuracies or missing connections |
| **Demo/Visuals** | Clear, engaging, and reinforces the math | Supports explanation but less polished | Minimal or unclear visual support |
| **Real-World Connection** | Strong and relevant example | Example is present but could be more relevant | Weak or missing example |
| **Clarity** | Well-organized, easy to follow | Mostly clear, minor confusion | Hard to follow, disorganized |
| **Engagement** | Audience actively involved, creative delivery | Audience somewhat engaged | Little audience engagement |

---

## Tips for Success
- Start with a **hook** — a surprising fact, question, or quick demo.
- Think about **why** this topic is useful or interesting — that’s your “so what?”
- Keep formulas **visible but not overwhelming** — focus on what they mean.
- Rehearse your demo so it works smoothly.

---

## Extra Credit Options
- Include a **comparison of multiple contexts** for your derivative concept.
- Write code (Python, Desmos, GeoGebra) to make your demo interactive.
- Bring in a **physical experiment** or measurement.

---

**Remember:** This is your chance to show the class that the derivative isn’t just a tool for homework problems — it’s a way of understanding the world.
